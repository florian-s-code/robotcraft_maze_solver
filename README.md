## Video
Have a look at [**this video**](https://youtu.be/2B_4M2gSJ1M) from a previous year for a simple strategy to solve the maze.

----
## Development
Robotcrafters, please create a _maze_solver.cpp_ or a _maze_solver.py_ source file (in the "src" folder) to program your own robots' behavior.
Please also create a _maze.launch_ launch file (in the "launch" folder) to launch stage and your node.

----
## Usage

After creating the launch file, just do:

```
roslaunch robotcraft_maze maze.launch
```
