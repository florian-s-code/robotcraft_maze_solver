# RobotCraft maze solver

[ROS Melodic Morenia](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) package implementing two different maze solving algorithms for the Robotcraft robot (a simple differential robot using IR-sensors and Lidar).

This was developped by a group of 3 during the [RobotCraft](http://robotcraft.ingeniarius.pt) summer program 2019.

Based on on a *robotcraft_maze* template package by David Portugal, ISR-UC.
